# PSyGS Gen: Parallel Symmetric Gauss-Seidel Generator

PSyGS is a generator of domain specific architectures to execute
the symmetric Gauss-Seidel algorithm in parallel, exploiting
dependency-free data preprocessed with coloring algorithms.

This repository contains:
* the chisel code of the generator
* the scripts to test the generated DSAs on FPGA (VC707 board)
* the scripts to test the software implementation of parallel SyGS
* the report of the project
* the presentation slides of the project
* the presentation video of the project
